## Assignment: Cutting Stock 2D Genetic Algorthims
<!-- Describe cutting stock problem -->
Cuttin Stock Problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that arises in many industrial applications. The problem consists of cutting stocks of material into smaller pieces in order to meet the demand for smaller pieces. The objective is to minimize the number of stocks used to meet the demand for smaller pieces. The problem is NP-hard and can be solved using integer programming techniques.

Below is a demonstration of greedy algorithm for cutting stock problem.
